Xsource it's a WPF application that helps with the management of translation resources (.resx files) across multiple projects.

The main view is the grid of translations. The grid is grouped by projects and the by the type of the project resources.

In this grid we can see the key (Designation) of the resource and the values.

A lot of features such <kbd>Ctrl+f</kbd>, groupings... are available. 
 -  <kbd>Ctrl+e</kbd> or double click for editing
 -  <kbd>Ctrl+n</kbd> for a new resource.
 - <kbd>Ctrl+del</kbd> for deleting

On new / edit mode, there is a DeepL request for translating directly. You obviously need to fill at least one field in order to get a translation. You can cancel your changes or overwrite the .resx file.
